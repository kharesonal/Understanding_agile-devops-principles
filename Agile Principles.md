*Agile Principles*
Explain the core principles of Agile methodology. How do these principles emphasize adaptability and customer collaboration? 

Agile principles promote adaptability and customer collaboration in several ways, including: 
Adaptability
Agile principles encourage adaptability by welcoming changing requirements throughout the development process. This allows teams to respond to evolving customer needs and market conditions. 
Customer collaboration
Agile principles emphasize working closely with customers to better understand their needs and expectations. This collaborative approach allows for more flexibility and adaptability, making it easier to accommodate changes. 
Frequent delivery of working software
Agile principles emphasize delivering working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months. This allows teams to gather real-world feedback from users, stakeholders, or customers early on. 
Regular communication and teamwork
Agile principles promote regular communication and teamwork, ensuring that developers, testers, and stakeholders are all on the same page. 
Continuous improvement
Agile principles encourage continuous reflection and adjustment, fostering a culture of learning and improvement within teams.
